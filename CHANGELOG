    Now it's OAuth. Breaks compatibility with the w3m version, but we'll live :)
    Also everything is in a class called TwiGI now so code is [hopefully]
    neater.
    Note that all tokens are kept in cookies in plaintext,
    so a replay attack (via the service itself) is possible.
    It's still safer than twitpic :), but if you worry about this,
    revoke access from the app at http://twitter.com/settings/connections
    when you're through playing with it (you can login again later).
    This will be fixed soon.

  * Fixed a retweet related bug (use retweeted_status and not the RT iself)
  * started using FileCache. So simple to do in tweepy.
  * Nicer error message if rate_limit_status reached
Ver 0.02, 2010-03-29
  * Supports both "me too" retweet and old fashioned editable RT
  * Neater GUI: less in timeline view, more in single status view
    (thanks to @ThaiFoodBlog for the criticism)
  * Added relativeDates.py by Jehiah Czebotar http://jehiah.com/
    (convert time to strings like "23 minutes ago")
